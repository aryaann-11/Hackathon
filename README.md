# TREEFER

## Short Description 

### What's the problem?
We observed that there are many environmental drives, seminars, fundraising events, etc  that are organized by different committees everyday. However, despite such great initiatives, these fail to receive the participation they deserve. 
Since the publicity is scattered it gets difficult for an interested individual to find a way to contribute or join these drives at a location convenient at the time. For the same reason, it becomes a tedious job for an NGO or an individual to get volunteers for their drives. 
There is also an absence of a community for environment protection enthusiasts that allows contributing as per the time, date and location preferences of the user who wants to take an initiative and create its own event.

### How can technology help?
The advent of technology has successfully connected people. This power of technology can be directed towards uniting people for a good cause. 
Using a web application technology will enable people to connect with each other over brilliant ideas for protecting the environment. Moreover, one can also get in touch with his/her surroundings, stay updated about nearby events and participate. This will make it easier for a user to take initiatives and conduct events and drives to fruitfully realize his/her noble vision. A lot more people can be a part of saving the environment as ease of accessibility and quick connectivity will result in maximum participation.

### The idea
Climate change increasingly poses one of the biggest long term threats to our society. Preservation of the environment, promotion of sustainable development and particular attention to climate change are matters of grave concern which we aim to address by bringing forth a technical solution.
Treefer is a web app that aims to bring about a positive change for the betterment of the environment.It aims to satisfy the 13th sustainable development goal of ‘Climate Action’. Through our web app we aim to identify regions where environmental drives are being conducted. Users can RSVP to the drives they wish to be a part of. (For example - Cleaning drive, ploggathons, tree plantation drives, painting to beautify the polluted infrastructure, etc). A user can also initiate a drive by creating his/her own event.

## Long Description 
Climate change, if left unchecked, poses a fatal threat to the ecological system as well as human civilization. According to a 2018 report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change, the worst impacts of climate change could be irreversible by 2030. Owing to this, it becomes essential for us , as citizens, to come forward and take active steps in saving our planet.It aims to satisfy the 13th sustainable development goal of ‘Climate Action’.
	Fortunately,  there are various organizations , clubs and communities that conduct regular drives to contribute to protect our environment. These vary from cleanliness drives to tree plantation drives and so on. However, these are not easily accessible to the general public because of lack of targeted publicity or scattered and individual sources providing information about their drives. 
 	Hence , we propose ‘Treefer’. Treefer is a web application that aims to solve the above mentioned problems and provide one easy to use platform. Through the web app, we aim to display environmental promotional drives near the user’s location.The user first has to login to our web app and is directed to a google authentication sign up page.There he/she has to sign up and login by providing his/her email and password.
The user can then book an event that is close to his area/region which he can easily locate through the map functionality. Additionally, he/she may also choose to host an event through our platform.
	The user has to register or sign up for the event by providing details like the name of the event, address, start date of event, end date of event.We have added a facility wherein the user can upload his/her photos/documents from gallery, google drive or even social media platforms like facebook and instagram.
Another useful feature that we have added is the RSVP of an event once the user has registered for that  particular event.An acknowledgement mail would be sent to him/her once the registration of the particular event has been carried out successfully.

### Future aspects 
- Social media aspect 
- Gamify the website. Give user’s incentives for using our website like organizing competitions giving free coupons
- Building an easier to use application.
- Adding climate related articles and content
